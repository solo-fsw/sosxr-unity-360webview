A fairly direct copy of Matt's implementation of the Subtitle Playable (Renamed to TMPro instead of Subtitle).

A couple of points to note:
1) Set the color of the text in the inspector.
2) Make sure not to use alpha in setting the color: this is controlled by the easing, and allows for fading the text in and out.
Don't use easing if you dont want the text to fade.
3) The 'previousIndex' in the TrackMixer is there to make sure that behaviour is only turned on/off once instead of on every frame.
4) Can be run while application is running (Play Mode & Build) as well as in the Editor (Timeline window)

You need to have Text Mesh Pro package installed.
This custom playable as been made with version 1.0.3, but should work with other releases too.

Feel free to amend these scripts to your liking. Check out the above resources for additional information on how to do so.
