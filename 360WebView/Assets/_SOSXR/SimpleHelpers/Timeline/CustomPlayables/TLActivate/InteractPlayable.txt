This versatile custom playable allows you to start a method via Timeline. It uses an interface (ITLActivate), and a method TLActivate();
Create your own class which implements ITLActivate, and use the TLActivate() method to either put in all your desired behaviour (see ExampleOneInteracting),
or link to your own method inside the interface method (see ExampleTwoInteracting).

A few things to note:
1) Each class you want to control with this needs to have the interface ITLActivate implemented, and the TLActivate() method as well.
2) The class which has the TLActivate interface attached to it is referenced in the clip.
3) The method can be called at clip start and / or clip finish. Beware that clip finish is a little weird.
4) Can be ONLY run while application is running (Play Mode & Build)

Feel free to amend these scripts to your liking. Check out the above resources for additional information on how to do so.
