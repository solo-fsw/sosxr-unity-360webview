The custom LUT Playable allows you to control the LookupTexture (ColorLookup) on a VolumeProfile through Timeline.
This allows you to change the overall tone (and emotion) of the scene through Timeline.

In case you want to use these scripts 'as is', there are three things to keep in mind:
1) Add a Volume Profile to the track, and set the Texture you wish to use in the Clip settings.
2) The LUT Contribution is default set to max, but can range anywhere from 0 to 1.
3) All values that require easing (in your setup), should be 0 prior to the first clip starting. This is because currently
I couldn't get the 'inverse easing' to work correctly. The ease-in worked fine (floatValue * (1 - inputWeight),
instead of floatValue * inputWeight), but this wouldn't do for the ease-out.
If you happen to work this out, please send us your improvements :)!
4) Checks to see if the override states in the Volume Profile are set to true prior to running the
5) Can ONLY be run while application is running (Play Mode & Build)
6) Can easily be extended to control other Volume parameters as well. Make sure to grab the correct component,
(see LUTTrackMixer for ColorLookup example):

	private Tonemapping toneMapping;
	private Bloom bloom;
	private ChromaticAberration chromaticAberration;
	private Vignette vignette;
	private LensDistortion lensDistortion;
	private ColorLookup colorLookup;

	private void GetOverrides(VolumeProfile data)
	{
		data.TryGet(out toneMapping);
		data.TryGet(out bloom);
		data.TryGet(out chromaticAberration);
		data.TryGet(out vignette);
		data.TryGet(out lensDistortion);
		data.TryGet(out colorLookup);
	}

Afterwards, set each of the values (usually float) using the respective component + '.value', like you see in the
"SetValuesToComponent" method in the LUTTrackMixer class.

Feel free to amend these scripts to your liking. Check out the above resources for additional information on how to do so.
