You need to have Animation Rigging package installed.
This custom playable as been made with version 1.0.3, but should work with other releases too.

This custom playable allows you to set the value of an entire rig via Timeline. Therefore, the best setup is to have
all constraints which govern a single rig or single movement as a single rig, and have different rigs govern different actions.

A few things to keep in mind:
1) The Animation Rigging package does not allow transforms to be swapped during play mode. If the position of the IK
is desired to change: change the position of the target, instead of changing targets mid-stream.
3) All values that require easing (in your setup), should be 0 prior to the first clip starting. This is because currently
I couldn't get the 'inverse easing' to work correctly. The ease-in worked fine (floatValue * (1 - inputWeight),
instead of floatValue * inputWeight), but this wouldn't do for the ease-out.
If you happen to work this out, please send us your improvements :)!
4) Can ONLY be run while application is running (Play Mode & Build)

Feel free to amend these scripts to your liking. Check out the above resources for additional information on how to do so.
