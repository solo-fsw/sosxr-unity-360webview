The custom parenting playable allows you to parent a gameobject (the one the track is bound to), to another (the one on the clip).


In case you want to use these scripts 'as is', there are three things to keep in mind:
1) The Timeline system works on a ScriptableObject base. This means (amongst other things) that it actually cannot
keep track of references to gameobjects / transforms / components in the scene, other than the ones your track is bound to.
Therefore, the clip needs to find any references you link to the clip. In this case it's done by first setting the clip-name
to the name of the bound GameObject. Then, if the reference to that GameObject is lost, it searches your scene for the correct one.
Therefore, make sure you only have one gameobject with that name in the scene, and that the name of the clip is the same as the
gameobject you're interested in.
2) It is recommended to have that 'parent' be an object which is a child of the actual parent you want to use. Then, let the
track-gameobject parent itself to this parent, and adjust the position and the rotation of this gameobject.
For example:
I have a flashlight which I want my character to hold in her right hand.
I create a child of the right hand, called 'RightHandFlashLightHolder'.
I bind the track to the flashlight.
In the clip, I reference 'RightHandFlashLightHolder' as my parent.
During PlayMode, I pause the Timeline once the flashlight is parented to the 'RightHandFlashLightHolder'.
I adjust rotation and position of the 'RightHandFlashLightHolder', so that the flashlight seems to be held correctly.
I save the values of the 'RightHandFlashLightHolder' transform (either copy those values, or use something like PlayModeSaver: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/play-mode-saver-104836 ).
Now, every time the flashlight is parented to the right hand (via the 'RightHandFlashLightHolder'), it looks to be correct.
3) Can ONLY be run while application is running (Play Mode & Build). You can change this if you want, however, keep in mind
that Unity remembers values changed during Edit mode, including those via Timeline.

Feel free to amend these scripts to your liking. Check out the above resources for additional information on how to do so.
