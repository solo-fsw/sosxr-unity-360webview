The custom Lights Playable allows you to control the light settings through Timeline.

In case you want to use these scripts 'as is':
1) The light you wish to control should be set either to 'Mixed' or to 'Realtime'.
2) Light Intensity range is between 0 and 50. Intensity being affected by inputWeight (easing).
You can change the allowed range of the intensity in LightsClip.
3) Light Range... uh... range is between 0 and 50. Range is being affected by inputWeight (easing).
If you want to change the allowed range, do this in LightsClip.
4) All values that require easing (in your setup), should be 0 prior to the first clip starting. This is because currently
I couldn't get the 'inverse easing' to work correctly. The ease-in worked fine (floatValue * (1 - inputWeight),
instead of floatValue * inputWeight), but this wouldn't do for the ease-out.
If you happen to work this out, please send us your improvements :)!
5) The previousIndex in the TrackMixer is there to make sure that behaviour is only turned on/off once instead of on every frame.
6) Can be run while application is running (Play Mode & Build) as well as in the Editor (Timeline window)

Feel free to amend these scripts to your liking. Check out the above resources for additional information on how to do so.
